This growth is driven primarily by strong demand for obesity treatment and\n            the expanding indication portfolio beyond diabetes.\n\n            Market Leaders:\n            Novo Nordisk dominates the market with two blockbuster products: Ozempic (semaglutide)\n            generating $14.2 billion in annual sales (59% year-over-year growth) and Wegovy\n            (semaglutide for obesity) achieving $4.5 billion (320% growth since launch).\n\n            Eli Lilly has rapidly gained market share with Mounjaro (tirzepatide), which has generated\n            $5.1 billion since its 2022 launch. The drug's dual GIP/GLP-1 mechanism shows superior\n            efficacy in both glucose control and weight loss compared to pure GLP-1 agonists.\n\n            AstraZeneca maintains a presence with their once-weekly exenatide formulation, though\n            facing increasing pressure from newer agents.\n\n            Regional Breakdown:\n            - North America: 62% of global market ($14.6B)\n            - Europe: 24% ($5.6B)\n            - Asia-Pacific: 11% ($2.6B)\n            - Rest of World: 3% ($0.7B)\n\n            Market Dynamics:\n            The obesity indication has become the primary growth driver, with estimates suggesting\n            70% of new prescriptions are for weight loss rather than diabetes. Supply constraints\n            have been a significant challenge, with both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly reporting\n            backorders and production scale-up investments exceeding $6 billion.\n\n            Future Outlook:\n            Market forecasts project the GLP-1 market to reach $45.8 billion by 2030, driven by:\n            - Expansion into cardiovascular disease prevention\n            - Potential approval for NASH/MASH treatment\n            - Oral formulation development (Novo's oral semaglutide in Phase 3)\n            - Next-generation molecules with improved dosing profiles\n            - Biosimilar entry expected post-2028 (first patent expiries)\n            ",
